# Dogs Database

This is an app that combines data fetched from an external dogs API with the ability to create your own dog and store it. <br>

Technologies and libraries used: <br>
  - React <br>
  - React redux to manage global state <br>
  - Redux Thunk as middleware to support async calls with redux <br>
  - Express to manage the back-end requests from the front-end
  - PostgreSQL to store new data <br>
  - Sequelize to connect the database with the back-end <br>
<br>
Stetically speaking is awful, but internally this app uses a combination of front-end and back-end filters that allow the user to find any kind of dog in seconds. <br>
